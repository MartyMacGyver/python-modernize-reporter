Python Modernize Reporter
=========================

This library is a very thin wrapper around `Modernize
<https://github.com/python-modernize/python-modernize>`_ that allows
linter-like output as well as optional integration with TeamCity.

In addition, this will optionally update files as ``modernize`` would.

See the ``LICENSE`` file for the license of ``python-modernize-reporter``.
Using this tool does not affect licensing of the modernized code.

Usage
-----

Run ``python-modernize-reporter --help`` for a full list of options.
